# puts x - y 

# #Multiplication
# puts x * y

# # Exponent Operator 

# # The ** represents the exponent operator for raising a number to a power to perform exponentiation.
# b = 3
# a = 2

# puts a**b 

# puts 3 ** 2
# # All operators can also be used with floating point values.


# # Shorthand Assignment Operators

# puts "------"


# a = 8
# a /= 3

# puts 4 % a 


# Parallel Assingment

=begin
    Ruby also supports parallel assigment of variables. 
    This enables multiple variables to be initializad 
    with a single line of code.
