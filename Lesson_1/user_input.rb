# Input

=begin 
    To get input from the user in Ruby, you use the gets method, 
    which returns what the user types as a string. 
    To store the input for later use, 
    you can assign the return value to a variable.
=end 

# x = gets

# puts x

# gets gets a line of text, including the new line at the end. If you do not want to include the new line, use the gets.chomp method:

# puts "Enter Your Name!"

# puts "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%"

# name = gets.chomp

# puts "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%"

# puts "Welcome, #{name}"

# puts "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%"

=begin 
    The Value of the input is a string. To convert it to an integer,
    you can use the gets.to_i method.
=end

#quiz

# temp = gets
# puts "You entered #{temp}"

ice = "7"
# because this is being added together with Strings.
ice += "2"

puts ice


a = 4

puts a**2

# mutltiple by twice 4 * 2 = 8 * 2 = 16
