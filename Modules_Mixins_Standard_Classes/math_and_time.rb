# Standard Classes

=begin
    Ruby provides a number of standard built-in classes that make our life a lot easier 
    by providing useful methods for manipulating data.
    Some of the classes in previous lessons include Array, String and Struct.
    Another useful class is the Math class, which provides methods to perform 
    mathematical operations.
    For example:
=end

# square root
puts Math.sqrt(9)

puts "------"
# pi constant
puts Math::PI

puts "------"
# trigonometry (sin, cos, tan)
puts Math::cos(0)

puts "------"

# Run the code and see how it work!
