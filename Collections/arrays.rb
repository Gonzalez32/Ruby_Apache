# Arrays

=begin
    An Array is essentially a list of numbered items.
    The items are declared in a comma-separated list and
    enclosed in square brackets.
    
    For example:
=end

puts "++++++++++++++++++++++"

items = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"]

=begin
    The code above declares an array named items containing three strings.

    Each item has its own unique index with the first item at index zero.
    To refer to an item, we need to refer to its index:
=end

puts items[0]

# You can assign any array element a new value by using its index:

# items[1] = "Kiwi"
